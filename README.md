# GoTiny Website

The GoTiny website is the easiest and quickest way to generate a short link. When visiting the website, the visitor is greeted by a clean page with a large input field. Because the field autofocuses, a long link can immediately be pasted. Upon submitting, [the API](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api) is called and the short link will be presented.

Links shortened on [gotiny.cc](https://gotiny.cc) are stored in `localStorage` and presented to the visitor in the Local History section. From here, users can copy previously shortened links or clear all locally saved entries.

#### Built With

- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)

Creating short links with GoTiny is accessible for everyone at [gotiny.cc](https://gotiny.cc) and for developers there's an [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk) which is free and doesn't require authentication.
